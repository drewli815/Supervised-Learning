In this project I utilized K-fold cross validation with Linear Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression to generate a prediction model that can predict whether a Swiss Bank Note was genuine or counterfeit. I also did factor analysis to see if lowering dimensionality would produce a better prediction model.
